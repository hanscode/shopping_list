# Shopping List Application

## Overview

This simple Python script allows users to create and manage a shopping list interactively. Through a series of commands, users can add items to the list, view the current list, or receive help on how to use the application. The script is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear prompts and feedback throughout the interaction.

The application operates in a command-line interface (CLI), making it a practical tool for quick modifications and updates to your shopping needs. Whether you're planning a grocery run or gathering supplies for a project, this shopping list app makes it easy to keep track of what you need.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Allows users to add items to their shopping list.
- **View List:** Users can view all items currently on the list at any time.
- **Interactive Help:** Users can type 'HELP' to display helpful information about the available commands.
- **Continuous Interaction:** The application runs in a loop, accepting commands until the user types 'DONE'.

## Commands

- `DONE` - Stops the input loop and displays the final list.
- `HELP` - Shows help information about the commands.
- `SHOW` - Displays all the items currently on the shopping list.

## Development Background
This application was developed as part of a Python Techdegree program at Treehouse, an online tech education platform specializing in coding and web development. This project serves as a practical application of Python basics, focusing on list manipulation, loops, functions, and user input handling. The goal of this project is not only to create a functional application but also to demonstrate a clear understanding of fundamental Python programming concepts learned through Treehouse's structured learning path.
